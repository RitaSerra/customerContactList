# Customer contact List

## Introduction

This is a frontend for manage customer contact list in an imaginary store. This prototype was generated with vue-cli v3 and was developed using vuejs and vuex

In this application the user has 4 functionalities:

- List all active customers
- Add new customers
- Update customers information
